Introduction of the isobar-freed fit leads to linear dipendencies among the waves in the fit model.
This can be seen by means of the integral matrix (now $w$ and $v$ are wave indices)
\begin{equation}
    I_{wv} \coloneqq \int_\Omega \psi_w^*(\tau)\,\psi_v(\tau)\ud\tau
\end{equation}
which represents the integrated overlap of the waves $w$ and $v$ over the phase space.
Since $I$ is hermitian, its eigenvalues are real.
So
\begin{equation}
    I^{\text{Tot}} \coloneqq \int_\Omega \abs{\A(\tau)}^2\!\ud \tau = \sum_{v,w \in \Set{\text{waves}}} T_w^* I_{wv} T_v.
\end{equation}
