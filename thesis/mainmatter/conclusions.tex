\chapter{Conclusions \& outlook}

    \ac{pwa} is a key tool for heavy-meson spectroscopy.
    \ac{pwa} is computationally expensive, thus the need for a fast amplitude calculator is critical.


    \section{TODO in my utlity}


    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
            Bins with small number of events are ambiguous. 
            An improvement to my fit utility is to implement an adaptive-binning algorithm, which automatically selects the bin extremes to have all the bins contain the same number of elements.
            This has been done manually in the fits above.

        \item Mixed model-independent and model-dependent \ac{pwa} formalisms;

        \item Derivative of the log-likelihood for fast fit convergence.
    \end{itemize}
