	Assume with a fraction $p$ of its code parallelized running on $N$ processors.
	\begin{block}{Strong Scaling}
		Measure of how, for a fixed overall problem size, the time to solution decreases
		\begin{equation}\tag{Amdahl's Law}
			S = \frac{1}{(1-p) + p/N} \le \frac{1}{1-p}.
		\end{equation}
		Increasing $p$ may be more useful than buying new fancy hadrware.
	\end{block}

	\begin{block}{Weak Scaling}
		Measure of how, for a fixed problem size \emph{per processor}, the time to solution changes
		\begin{equation}\tag{Gustafson's Law}
			S = N + (1-p)(1-N) \ge 1.
		\end{equation}
	\end{block}
