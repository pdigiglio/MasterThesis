		Some library exist, which are already implemented in \cuda{} and \gpu-optimized such as \lstinline!cuBLAS! (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms), \lstinline!cuFFT! (Fast Fourier Transform), \lstinline!Thrust!.

		\begin{block}{Thrust}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item C++ template library for \cuda{} based on the \stl{};%~\cite[p.~1]{cuda:thrust};
				\item Manages low level operation such as memory allocation on \gpu{} and copying data between Host and Device;
				\item Provides a large number of common parallel algorithm e.g.~ sortings, transformations reductions.%\lstinline!thrust::sort!, \lstinline!thrust::reduce!
			\end{itemize}
