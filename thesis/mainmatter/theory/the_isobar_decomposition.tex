\section{Isobar decomposition}

    In quantum mechanics, the quantity that describes the distribution of the observed events in an experiment is the event intensity\index{intensity}, $\Intensity(\tau)$, being $\tau$ the phase-space coordinate of the event.
    The intensity is defined as the squared magnitude of the event probability amplitude\index{amplitude}:
    \begin{equation}
        \Intensity(\tau) \coloneqq \abs{\A(\tau)}^2.
    \end{equation}
    In this section I will show how to write down the expression for the probability amplitude of a decay, $\A$, by means of the \ac{pwa} formalism, which---in this context---I will also call \emph{isobar formalism}\index{formalism!isobar}\index{isobar!formalism}.


    In the isobar formalism, a resonance\index{resonance} is a bound state of particles with well-defined quantum numbers.\footnote{Please note that a bound state of resonances is a resonance too.}
    The quantum numbers that characterize a resonance are its isospin, its spin, $J$, its parity, $P$, and its charge-conjugation parity, $C$.
    The notation usually adopted to indicate the resonance quantum numbers is $J^{PC}$.
    Decaying particles can associate in resonances in more than one way, \ie~the decay can proceed through different topologies\index{decay topology}.


    A set of bound states with the same quantum numbers is called \emph{isobar}\index{isobar}.
    Consequently, the decomposition of a decay amplitude in terms of isobars is called \emph{isobar model}\index{isobar!model} or formalism.
    In this formalism, the decay amplitude of an initial-state particle, $X$, into a set of final-state particles---whose coordinate in the phase space is $\tau$---can be written as the following coherent sum of all the contributions from the isobars that are allowed by the conservation laws:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:isobar_decomposition}
        \A_X(m_X,\tau) = \sum_{I\in\set{(J, P, C)}} c_I \Psi_I(m_X, \tau),
    \end{equation}
    being $c_I$ a complex coefficient quantifying the relative weight of the $I$-th isobar decay amplitude, $\Psi_I$.
    I would like to stress that in the equation~\eqref{eq:isobar_decomposition} I omitted the sum over the decay topologies, as I will do in the following discussion.
    Please also note that, in the context of the isobar decomposition, the partial waves correspond to the isobars.


%    In heavy-meson decays, a known initial-state particle decays to a known final state.
%    As the initial-state particle has a well-defined invariant mass, and fixes the $C$ and $P$ quantum numbers of the decay, the isobar decomposition can be simplified as follows:
%    \begin{equation}\label{eq:heavy_meson_isobar_decomposition}
%        \A(\tau) = \sum_{J} c_J \Psi_J(\tau),
%    \end{equation}
%    where I dropped the dependence on the initial-particle mass; and parity, and charge-conjugation parity quantum numbers.
%    The next sections will be on how to find a mathematical expression for the isobar amplitude $\Psi_J(\tau)$.

        Alternative topologies for the decay would have a resonance in the $bc$ or $ac$ channels.}
        \label{fig:isobar_three_body_decay}
    \end{figure}
    To reduce the complexity of the decay model, I will assume that the initial-state particle decays to the final-state particles via subsequent two-body decays, as schematically depicted in figure~\ref{fig:isobar_three_body_decay}.
    This assumption has been verified in non-leptonic three-body \PD{} and \PB{} decays~\cite[\S~13.2]{Bevan:2014iga}.


    Allowing only two-body sub-decays, the $\PDplus \to \Ppiplus\Ppiminus\Ppiplus$ decay will proceed as:
    \begin{equation}
        \PDplus\to\xi\Ppiplus,\qquad
        \xi\to\Ppiplus\Ppiminus,
    \end{equation}
    being $\xi$ and unknown resonance.
    The allowed resonances include, for example, the \Pfnez{} in the $0^{++}$ state, such that $\Pfnez\Ppiplus$ is in the $0^{-+}$ state;
    the \Prhozero{} in the $1^{--}$ state, such that $\Prhozero\Ppiplus$ is in the $1^{--}$ state;
    and the \Pfii{} in the $2^{++}$ state, such that $\Pfii\Ppiplus$ is in the $2^{++}$ state.


    I have taken the $J^{PC}$ values of the previous resonances from~\cite{chinese_phisics}.
    For the composite state of the resonance and the \emph{spectator}\index{spectator particle} (or \emph{bachelor}\index{bachelor particle}) particle, $\xi\Ppiplus$, I evaluate the state as follows. 
    The angular-momentum conservation reads
    \begin{equation}
        \vec{J}_{\PD} = \vec{L} + \vec{J}_{\xi} + \vec{J}_{\Ppi},
    \end{equation}
    where, as shown in the figure~\ref{fig:isobar_three_body_decay}, $\vec{L}$ is the angular-momentum operator between the bachelor particle, $\Ppiplus$, and the resonance, $\xi$; and I have dropped the particle superscripts to make the formula less cumbersome.
    As both the \Ppiplus{} and the \PDplus are spinless particles, $\vec{J}_{\PD} = \vec{J}_{\Ppi} = 0$; thus
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:angular_momentum_sum}
        \abs{J_{\xi} - L} \le 0 \le J_{\xi} + L.
    \end{equation}
    In particular, the left-hand inequality in the~\eqref{eq:angular_momentum_sum} implies that---for the specific decay under exam---the spin of the resonance, $J_\xi$, must be equal to $L$, the angular-momentum quantum number of the $\xi\Ppiplus$ system.


    The parity is a multiplicative quantum number, and couples with the angular momentum.
    So the parity of the $\xi\Ppiplus$ system is
    \begin{equation}
        P_{\xi\Ppi} = (-1)^L P_{\xi} P_{\Ppi} = (-1)^{L+1} P_{\xi}.
    \end{equation}


    Finally, the charge-conjugation parity is undefined for charged particles, so the $\xi\Ppiplus$ system will have the same value of $C$ as the resonance's. 


    Having set the context of the isobar formalism, I will now discuss how to write down the explicit form of the contributions to the decay amplitude~\eqref{eq:isobar_decomposition}.
    Each isobar amplitude can be decomposed in the following terms:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:isobar_amplitude}
        \Psi_I(\tau) = \psi_J(\tau)\,\mathcal{F\!}_{J}(\tau)\,\Delta_I(s)\,\A_{d_1}\!(m_{d_1\!}; \tau)\,\A_{d_2}\!(m_{d_2\!}; \tau).
    \end{equation}
    Here $\psi_J$ is the spin-dependent part of the decay amplitude;
    $\mathcal{F\!}_J$ is the Blatt-Wei\ss{}kopf penetration factor;
    $\Delta_I$ is the dynamic shape of the isobar;
    and $\A_{d_1}$ and $\A_{d_2}$ are the amplitudes of the decays of $d_1$ and $d_2$, the daughter particles (or resonances) of the sub-decay.
    These amplitudes have to be evaluated recursively by means of the equation~\eqref{eq:isobar_decomposition}.
    Please note again that I am only allowing the decay to proceed via two-body sub-decays.


    In what follows, when not explicitly written, I will imply the sum over the Bose-Einstein symmetrizations of the indistinguishable particles---\ie~the final-state \Ppiplus{} in the \PDplus{} decay under consideration.


    \paragraph{Spin-dependent amplitude}
    The spin-dependent amplitude, $\psi_J(\tau)$, describes the angular distribution of the decay and is fully specified by the spin quantum numbers of the initial-state particle, the isobar, and the final-state particles.
    There are a number of formalisms to parametrize $\psi_J(\tau)$.
    

    In the Zemach formalism\index{formalism!Zemach}\index{Zemach formalism}~\cite[\S~V.1]{PhysRev.140.B97}, the form of the decay angular dependence in terms of the final-state particles three-momenta is
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:zemach_formalism}
        \psi_{J}^{(ab)c}(\vec{p}_a,\vec{p}_c) = \frac{J!}{(2J-1)!!}\,P_J(\vec{\hat{p}}_a \cdot \vec{\hat{p}}_c)\,\abs{\vec{p}_a}^J\abs{\vec{p}_c}^J,
    \end{equation}
    where the superscript $(ab)c$ means that $c$ is the spectator particle;
    $P_J$ is the $J$-th Legendre polynomial, which only depends on the \emph{helicity angle}\index{helicity angle}, namely the angle between $a$'s and $c$'s momenta ($\vec{\hat{p}}_a$ and $\vec{\hat{p}}_c$ are unit vectors);
    and the three-momenta $\vec{p}_a$ and $\vec{p}_c$ are evaluated in the rest frame of the $ab$ system.

        \centering
        \caption{Expressions of the spin-dependent part of the isobar amplitude~\eqref{eq:isobar_amplitude} in the Zemach formalism for the first three integer values of $J$.
                 The three-momenta $\vec{p}_a$ and $\vec{p}_c$ are to be evaluated in the rest frame of the $ab$ subsystem.}
        \label{tab:zemach_formalism}
        
        \begin{tabular}{lc}
            \toprule
            $J$ &$\psi_J^{(ab)c}$\\
            \midrule
            $0$ &$1$ \\
            $1$ &$-2(\vec{p}_a\cdot\vec{p}_c)$ \\
            $2$ &$4(\vec{p}_a\cdot\vec{p}_c)^2 - 4(\abs{\vec{p}_a}\abs{\vec{p}_c})^2\!/3$\\
            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    The table~\ref{tab:zemach_formalism} shows the explicit expressions of $\psi_J$ in the Zemach formalism for $J\in\set{0,1,2}$.


    Another possible angular formalism is the helicity formalism\index{helicity formalism}\index{formalism!helicity}~\cite{jacob1959404}, which I will not discuss here.
    It is worth stressing that the physical prediction, $\Intensity(\tau)$, must be independent on the particular angular formalism one chooses to describe the decay.


    \paragraph{Blatt-Wei\ss{}kopf factors}

            $2$ &$\bigg(\displaystyle\frac{13 z^2 }{z^2 + 3z + 9}\bigg)^{1/2}$ \\
            \bottomrule

    \paragraph{Dynamic shape}
    Unlike the spin-dependent part of the isobar amplitude and the Blatt-Wei\ss{}kopf factors, there is no way to derive the dynamic shape from first principles.
    In the past, physicists have mostly adopted a heuristic model-dependent description to obtain the form of the dynamic shape.
    This approach is described in the following section; a model-independent approach is described in section~\ref{sec:model_independent_isobar_decomposition}.
