\chapter{Theory introduction}

    \Ac{pwa} is a standard technique in scattering theory.
    It allows to write down the the scattering probability amplitude in terms of Legendre polynomials, the eigenvectors of the angular momentum operator, each representing a partial\index{partial wave} wave~\cite[\S~11.2]{griffiths_intro_qm}.


    In this chapter, I will show how we apply the \ac{pwa} to heavy-meson decays to extract the various contributions to the decay amplitude.
    I will focus on the isobar decomposition of a spinless parent particle to three pseudo-scalar daughter particles in the final state.
    I will restrict to this case as I want to apply the formalism to the $\PDplus\to\Ppiplus\Ppiminus\Ppiplus$ decay.

    \subsection{Motivation}

    \paragraph{Why should I want to use one?}

    I'm not required to guess what's in the resonance thus introducing biases by an incorrect or incomplete model.
    The drawback is that the fit parameters increase a lot but this is not an issue due to the magnitude of the current data samples.


    \paragraph{Who guarantees me that you're telling the truth and the description works?}

    The fit result obtained via a model-independent description have been compared to the isobar ones.
    And they're compatible, you skeptical moron.


    Let's quote some previous collaborations tha already used a model-independent description to analyze their decays, such as~\cite{PhysRevD.73.032004,Link200914}.


    The approach is flexible because it allows a mixed formalism.
    The {\small FOCUS} collaboration, for instance, used it to describe the S-wave component of a $\PKminus\Ppiplus$ system from a $\PDplus \to \PKminus\Ppiplus\Ppiplus$ decay while still using a model dependent description for P and D waves~\cite{Link200914}.
