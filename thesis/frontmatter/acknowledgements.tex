    I am particularly grateful to Boris Grube for inviting me to write this thesis at the {\small E18} department, and for his delicious candy bears.
    Also, I thank Sebastian Uhl for the fruitful discussion on whether <<\si{\square{\giga\electronvolt}/\c^4}>> or <<\si{\square{(\giga\electronvolt/\square{\c})}}>> is the proper way to typeset the dimension of the squared invariant mass in the Dalitz plots.

    Last---but not least---I would like to thank you, Caffeine, I would have never made it without you!
