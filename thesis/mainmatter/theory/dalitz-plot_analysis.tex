\section{Dalitz-plot analysis}

    In a two-body decay, the energy-momentum conservation fully determines the energy of the final-state particles in the center-of-mass frame.
    In a three-body decay, after requiring energy and momentum conservation, there are still five remaining \acp{dof} in the center-of-mass frame of the final state (i.e.~the rest frame of the parent particle).
    If the initial and final state particles are spinless, up to an arbitrary rotation, two \acp{dof} remain.
    So, for the decay under consideration, the phase-space coordinate, $\tau$, is a two-element vector.

   
   There are several possible choices for the parameter pair to represent $\tau$.
    It is thus convenient to choose a couple of parameters such that the phase-space term is constant within the kinematically-allowed region they span.
    Two such variables are the square invariant masses of the two pairs of final-state particles, i.e.~$m_{ab}^2 = p_{ab}^2$ and $m_{bc}^2 = p_{bc}^2$, being $a$, $b$, and $c$ the labels for the final-state particles (see the figure~\ref{fig:isobar_three_body_decay}).


    The differential decay probability is
    \begin{equation}
        \ud\Gamma = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{1}{32 m_X^3}\abs{\A(m_{ab}^2, m_{bc}^2)}^2\!
        \ud m_{ab}^2 \!\ud m_{bc}^2.
    \end{equation}
    As the phase-space measure is a constant function throughout the whole phase space, any non-uniformity in the distribution of the events is to be ascribed to the decay amplitude only.

    The boundaries of the kinematically-allowed phase-space region, shown in figure~\ref{fig:dalitz_kinematically_allowed}, can be expressed in terms of a constrain on $m_{bc}^2$ as follows:
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            (m_{bc}^2)_{\text{max}} &= (E_b + E_c)^2 - (\abs{\vec{p}_b} - \abs{\vec{p}_c})^2,\\
            (m_{bc}^2)_{\text{min}} &= (E_b + E_c)^2 - (\abs{\vec{p}_b} + \abs{\vec{p}_c})^2,
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    where
    \begin{equation}
        E_b = \frac{m_{ab}^2 - m_a^2 + m_b^2}{2m_{ab}},\text{ and }
        E_c = \frac{m_X^2 - m_{ab}^2 - m_c^2}{2 m_{ab}}
    \end{equation}
    are the energies of the final-state particles $b$ and $c$ in the rest frame of the system $ab$ and
    \begin{equation}
        \abs{\vec{p}_b} = \sqrt{{E_b}^2 - m_b},\text{ and }
        \abs{\vec{p}_c} = \sqrt{{E_c}^2 - m_c}
    \end{equation}
    the corresponding 3-momenta magnitudes.
