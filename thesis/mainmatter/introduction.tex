\chapter{Introduction}

    The aim of this thesis is the description of \pac{yap}, a novel \ac{pwa} toolkit that I have contributed to develop.
    I also show the results of some model-independent fits performed using a self-developed piece of software relying on the external libraries \pac{yap} and \pac{bat}.

    \section{Physical motivation}

    Examples of usage:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Searches for new states;
        \item Measuging resonance properties;
        \item $CP$ violation;
        \item B and D mixing;
        \item Resolving ambiguities.
    \end{itemize}
