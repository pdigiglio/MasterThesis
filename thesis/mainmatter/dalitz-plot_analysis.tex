In a two-body decay, the energy-momentum conservation fully determines the energy of the final-state particles in the center-of-mass frame.
In a three-body decay, after requiring energy and momentum conservation, there are still five remaining \acp{dof} in the frame of the final state (i.e.~the rest frame of the parent particle).
If the initial and final state particles have spin zero, up to an arbitrary rotation, two \acp{dof} remain.


The amplitude of the three-body decay can be expressed with respect to several parameter pairs.
It is thus convenient to choose a couple of parameters such that the phase-space term is constant within the kinematically-allowed region they span.
Two such variables are the square invariant masses of the two pairs of final-state particles, i.e.~$m_{ab}^2 = p_{ab}^2$ and $m_{bc}^2 = p_{bc}^2$, being $a$, $b$, and $c$ the labels for the final-state particles.
The differential decay probability for a parent particle with mass $M$ into three final-state particles is
\begin{equation}
    \ud\Gamma = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{1}{32M^3}\abs{\A(m_{ab}^2, m_{bc}^2)}^2
    \ud m_{ab}^2 \!\ud m_{bc}^2.
\end{equation}
As the phase-space measure is a constant function, any non-uniformity in the distribution of $m_{ab}^2$ and $m_{bc}^2$ is due to the decay amplitude $\A$.

The kinematically-allowed phase-space region, shown in figure~\ref{fig:dalitz_kinematically_allowed}, can be expressed in terms of a constrain on $m_{bc}^2$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    (m_{bc}^2)_{\text{max}} &= (E_b^* + E_c^*)^2 - (p_b^* - p_c^*)^2,\\
    (m_{bc}^2)_{\text{min}} &= (E_b^* + E_c^*)^2 - (p_b^* + p_c^*)^2,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    E_b^* = \frac{m_{ab}^2 - m_a^2 + m_b^2}{2m_{ab}},\quad% \text{ and }
    E_c^* = \frac{M^2 - m_{ab}^2 - m_c^2}{2 m_{ab}}
\end{equation}
are the energies of the final-state particles $b$ and $c$ in the rest frame of the system $ab$ and
\begin{equation}
    p_b^* = \sqrt{{E_b^*}^2 - m_b^2},\quad% \text{ and }
    p_c^* = \sqrt{{E_c^*}^2 - m_c^2}
\end{equation}
the corresponding 3-momenta magnitudes.
