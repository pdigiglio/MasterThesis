In the isobar model only two-body decays are allowed.
The resonance, in turn, will decay into the particles $a$ and $b$.


This way, the~\eqref{eq:pwa_ang_mom} will be further decomposed into a coherent sum of the amplitudes that populate each wave:
\begin{equation}
    \A_L = \sum_r a_L^r \A_L^r,
\end{equation}
being $r$ and index for the alloewd resonances.
Resonances have to fulfill conservation laws at each decay vertex, just like particles.
Resonances are intermediary states that cannot, by their nature, be observed.
