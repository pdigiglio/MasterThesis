\chapter{Introduction}


    \paragraph{Some physical motivation}

    Heavy-meson decays are particularly useful to look for charge-conjugation an parity violation.


    Due to the availability of larger and larger data sets, the systematic uncertainties due to the \ac{pwa}---so far, the standard analysis technique for light- and heavy-meson decays---are dominating the statistical uncertainties.
    One of the greatest source of bias in the \ac{pwa} is the incorrect assumptions about the resonant content of the waves, \ie~wrong assumptions on the decay model.
    This motivates the development of a novel analysis approach, the \ac{mipwa}, which exploits the increased size of the data to get rid of unjustified model assumptions.
    

    Il mio studio si inserisce all'interno di un progetto pi√π generale del dipartimento di fisica, che sta cercando di formalizzare il \ac{mipwa} (zero waves).


    \Ac{pwa} is a common tools to analyze data.


    Also, through the Dalitz-plot analysis one can:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Searches for new states;
        \item Measuging resonance properties;
        \item $CP$ violation;
        \item B and D mixing;
        \item Resolving ambiguities.
    \end{itemize}

    A toolkit for \ac{pwa} is \pac{yap}.

    On top of \pac{yap} and \pac{bat} I have built a utility that implements a model-independent fit for analysis of $\PDplus\to\Ppiplus\Ppiminus\Ppiplus$ decays.

    \paragraph{Why model-independent analysis}

    Due to the availability of larger and larger data sets, the limiting factor in the data analysis is the quality of the model.


    Model-independent analysis can be useful to solve ambiguity like:

    ovelapping states

    not well-known resonances.

    \paragraph{goals of the thesis}

    I have contributed to the development of \pac{yap}, a novel toolkit for \ac{pwa}, briefly described in the chapter~\ref{chap:yap}.
    I have developed a fitting routine based on \pac{yap} that implements a model-independent fit.
    I have tested the routine on a variety of \ac{mc} data with increasing complexity (see the chapter~\ref{chap:model_independent_pwa}).





    The aim of this thesis is the description of \pac{yap}, a novel \ac{pwa} toolkit that I have contributed to develop.
    I also show the results of some model-independent fits performed using a self-developed piece of software relying on the external libraries \pac{yap} and \pac{bat}.
