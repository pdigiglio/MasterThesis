\chapter{Conclusions \& outlook}

    \ac{pwa} is a key tool for heavy-meson spectroscopy.
    \ac{pwa} is computationally expensive, thus the need for a fast amplitude calculator is critical.


    In the fits, I have parametrized the parameters with the amplitude and phase motion.
    The fits work.


    I can free multiple waves and the fit still works.
