\chapter{Theory introduction}
\label{chap:theory}

    \Ac{pwa}\index{partial-wave analysis} is a standard technique in scattering theory.
    It allows to write down the scattering probability amplitude in terms of Legendre polynomials, the eigenvectors of the angular momentum operator, each representing a partial\index{partial wave} wave~\cite[\S~11.2]{griffiths_intro_qm}.


    In this chapter, I will show how to apply the \ac{pwa} to heavy-meson decays to disentangle the various contributions to the decay amplitude.
    I will focus on the isobar decomposition of a spinless parent particle to three pseudo-scalar daughter particles in the final state.
    This is the case of the $\PDplus\to\Ppiplus\Ppiminus\Ppiplus$ decay, to which I will refer throughout the whole thesis.


    In the last part of the chapter, I will briefly introduce the reader to the Dalitz-plot, a particularly useful visualization tool in the \ac{pwa} of three-body particle decays.

    Let's quote some previous collaborations tha already used a model-independent description to analyze their decays, such as~\cite{PhysRevD.73.032004,Link200914}.
