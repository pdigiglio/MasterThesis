\label{chap:model_independent_pwa}

By means of a \acf{mipwa} one can study decays whose wave resonance content is not yet well known or whose resonance shapes are not yet precisely understood.
\citeauthor{PhysRevD.73.032004}, at Fermilab, first performed a \ac{mipwa} of a heavy-meson decay to parametrize the S-wave component of the $\PKminus{}\Ppiplus{}$ system in the $\PDplus\to\PKminus\Ppiplus\Ppiplus$ decay~\cite{PhysRevD.73.032004}.
\citeauthor{Link200914}, in the \focus{} collaboration, conducted a similar study on the same hadronic decay~\cite{Link200914}.


In this chapter, I will describe a utility I coded, which implements the \ac{mipwa} formalism.\marginpar{\centering\qrcode[height=2cm]{https://github.com/pdigiglio/ModelIndependentFit}\captionof*{figure}{Fit utility's \textsc{url}.}}
The utility is based on \pac{yap}---for the calculation of the decay amplitudes---and \pac{bat}---for the sampling of the phase space.
I will also show the result of the fits I performed on \ac{mc} data of $\PDplus\to\Ppiplus\Ppiminus\Ppiplus$ decays to test the utility.
The project is hosted on \textsf{GitHub} at \url{https://github.com/pdigiglio/ModelIndependentFit}.


    \section{The fit utility}

    The \ac{mipwa} utility implements a \pac{yap} decay model in which the dynamic shape of each isobar is a piecewise function.\footnote{So far, I did not yet implement the mixed formalism with freed and fixed waves.}
    The model assigns a non-fixed free amplitude to each mass bin of the dynamic shapes.
    The non-fixed free amplitudes are then mapped to fit parameters for the \pac{bat} sampler.
    \pac{bat} queries the model likelihood, and updates the fit parameters---and, consequently, the non-fixed free amplitudes of the \pac{yap} model---until it finds a maximum of the likelihood.


    Please note that unlike chapter~\ref{chap:yap}, where I reserved the word ``parameter'' to indicate the smart variables the \lstinline!MassShape! class depends on, here I will also call ``parameter'' a fit \ac{dof}.

                 %In this case, the initial guess for the fit parameters is the value of the \Pfii{} dynamic shape on the low edges of the bins that partition the mass range.}
        \label{fig:rt_par_fit}
    \end{figure}


    Due to the long fit runtimes, I implemented a real-time visualization tool with \ROOT{}.
    For each freed wave, the fit utility will create two canvases: one plots the dynamic-shape magnitude, the other the dynamc-shape phase.
    Each canvas contains two \ROOT{} graphs: the initial guess for the fit parameters, and the values of the fit parameters.
    The latter graph gets updated in real time at every fit iteration.
    Figure~\ref{fig:rt_par_fit} shows a screenshot of the dynamic-shape magnitude of a D wave (containing, in this case, a \Pfii{} resonance only).
    Looking at these canvas, the user can realize if there is some mistake in the fit without having to wait until it ends.

    \section{Fits}

    In this section I present the fits I performed by means of the utility described above.
    I generated the data to fit the model to using \pac{bat} as a \ac{mc} engine, and \pac{yap} as an amplitude calculator.
    Listing~\ref{lst:partial_cleo_decay} shows how to set up a \lstinline!Model! instance whose decay intensity can be used as the \ac{mc} sampling distribution to generate the data.


    In the following plots, first, I show the fits of phase motion (\eg~figure~\ref{fig:f0_only_phase_fit}) and dynamic-shape magnitude (\eg~figure~\ref{fig:f0_only_magnitude});
    then, a comparison between the source \ac{mc} data (\eg~figure~\ref{fig:dalitz_f0_980_only_source}) and a set of \ac{mc} data generated according to the model-independent decay amplitude whose parameters are fixed to the ones extracted from the fit (\eg~figure~\ref{fig:dalitz_f0_980_only_result}).
    Please note that in figure~\ref{fig:f0_only}, as in all the following fit plots, the bin error bars are on the left edge of the bin they refer to.

    \section{Future enhancements}

    Besides implementing a second-stage fit routine which corrects the wave content extracted from the Dalitz plots for the zero modes, the fit utility may benefit from the following enhancements:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            All the above fits show that bins with small number of events are ambiguous.
            An improvement to the fit utility I presented in this chapter may to implement an adaptive-binning algorithm, which automatically selects the bin boundaries such that all of them contain the same number of elements;


        \item
            As the user might not always want to free all the waves, the architecture of the fit utility should allow for mixed \ac{pwa} formalism. This would also allow to take advantage of well-established resonances to reduce the number of fit parameters;

        \item
            Exploit the knowledge about the derivative of the log-likelihood for fast fit convergence.
    \end{itemize}
